Amaterasu
=========

Hosting Control Panel

I am creating amaterasu after many years using GNUPanel because the development process of this hosting control panel
never was very colaborative and actually have an slow development process. 

The main core features that I want implement in amaterasu are:

  - DNS Manage
  - Celery tasks to replace cron jobs
  - Capacity to decide what services you want enable per client (web site, email, ftp, etc)
  - Quotas
  - Paypal Integration
  - Statistics
  
If you want request a new features, I will be happy evaluate your requests or you can fork this repo and contribute with the project.
